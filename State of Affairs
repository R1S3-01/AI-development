minimax is working and in great condition
MCTS is fully working and in great condition
Q-table is working BUT needs training
CNN needs more structural oprimisation and training, need to see if more layers would be better need to see if more neurons, need to play around with rewards


15/03/2025 changes:CNN
Test One
the replay buffer will be reduced by 75%
Implementing soft target network updates
added dropout of 0.1
added BatchNorm2d
lets run and see if the results look good or terrible

16/03/2025
Test Two
want to try 258 batch size
want to try 4 layers again
500 target network frequency and 1% updates

Test Three
258 batch size
3 layers
1000 target update frequency
2 Convo2D layers

The network is struggling to break its current level off progress.
To resolve this, im going to conduct a more exploration based training batch, keeping epsilon at a higher level for longer.
Also i will be breaking the training down more as to keep the training back more varied

Training the Q-network now for the last time and officially. Still need to do more CNN training but not much !
Q-Leaning training batch one
Qnet (P1) vs Mini D6 (P2)=0 wins this just isnt enough training with too high of a epsilon to find the win path but its okay for now this will change in time
Qnet (P1) vs MCTS T100 (P2)= Even with the massive epsilon we are getting lots of wins around 15% at the end which is good for so early on
Qnet (P1) vs Mini D6 (p2)=10% wins, this at first is counter intuative, but it must be something in how the Minimax plays P1 being more consistent than how it plays P2
6 depth and 100 rollouts epsilon start 1.00 epsilon end 0.17
7 depth and 300 rollouts epsilon start 1.00 epsilon end 0.17
8 depth and 500 rollouts epsilon start 0.75 epsilon end 0.20

This could be the last training ran, we will have too see...
we are doing mega mega training both on q table and DQN, what we are hoping is too see them both get rather good from this.
any weaknesses will be ironed out but im expecting them to be okay after this, if this ever ends....


Adjusted the player vs player settings to increase balance
Resolved major bug in how data was accumulated.

#Have to restart training from low MCTS decisive thats why there will be a likley increas in miniax time
