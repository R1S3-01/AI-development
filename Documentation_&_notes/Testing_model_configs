What is this testing being done for?
This is the testing for the testing in a strange way, it is important that the parameters applied to the models in the larger testing arena are fair and make sense
This testing is seeking to ensure that is the case, ensuring a fair balance between time and result and that the outcome isnt predictable enough not to need future testing

Whats important to understand is that MCTS can never have the same average time as Minimax without having much worse performance
This is due to the transposition table storing previous game/moves.
What im testing for is to ensure that the average time is semi close to each other, one cant have much more or less time taken than the other it would be unfair:

These are the results testing the models low versions with the settings:
Low-MCTS time = 0.25 | Low-Mini depth = 8
Player A= Low-MCTS(P1) vs Player B = Low-Mini(P2)
player A average move time =0.25361072350733027 
player B average move time =0.04915820964519052 
Draws | Low-MCTS wins | Low-Mini wins = [0, 14, 36]
------------------------------
Player B = Low-Mini(P1) vs Player A = Low-MCTS(P2)
player A average move time =0.2560769015609628 
player B average move time =0.06606038103945454 
Draws | Low-MCTS time wins | Low-Mini wins = [0, 31, 19]
------------------------------
However, from this testing, it is likely that minmax would be superior ina a low time based competition, it wins more and in less time...
================================================================================================================================================
Player A=High-MCTS(P1) vs Player B=High-Mini (P2)
player A average move time =1.0084562522913116 
player B average move time =0.5613451533499277 
Draws | High-MCTS wins | High-Mini wins = [4, 4, 42] 
------------------------------
Player B=High-Mini(P1) vs Player A=High-MCTS (P2)
player A average move time =1.0151803897325262 
player B average move time =0.4509629663668181 
Draws | High-MCTS wins | High-Mini wins = [0, 28, 22] 
------------------------------
Once again, we see that with around half the time taken Minimax has more wins, however, it is close and needs more testing and evaluating
============================================================================================================================================
Mini Id depth =14 time limit=1 | High-MCTS-Dec time limit =1
Player A=High-Mini-Id(P1) vs Player B=High-MCTS-Dec (P2)
player A average move time =0.799077938067033 
player B average move time =1.005613075286406 
Draws | High-Mini-Id wins | High-MCTS-Dec wins = [0, 47, 3] 
------------------------------
Player B=High-MCTS-Dec(P1) vs Player A=High-Mini-Id (P2)
player A average move time =0.5222631856506946 
player B average move time =1.0099298302866833 
Draws | High-Mini-Id wins | High-MCTS-Dec wins = [2, 48, 0]

What these results show is that High Mini ID is completely dominating High-MCTS-Dec.
However, it is taking a lot of time, averaging between 0.5 and 0.8 seconds per move. we see the time decrease due to transposition table
Thus i dont think its necessary to lower and Mini ID parameters as doing so would result in it being too fast and this is ment to be a high model.
