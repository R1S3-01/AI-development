This is the largest coding project i have ever undertaken and was done for my dissertation project.
The application is a simulated comparison of AI algorithms.
There are two main sections the interaactive game & the algorithm comparison competitions.

Algorithms implemented-
Minimax with ABP,move ordering, Itterative deepening and Transposition Table
Monte Carlo Tree Search
Q-Learning
Deep Q Learning- using CNN

Algorithm torniments implemented:
Round Robin competition
Evolutionary Torniment with elo ratings
